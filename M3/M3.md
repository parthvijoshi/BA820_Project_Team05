## Project Overview
This project analyzes the survival competition show **Alone** to understand how survival difficulty, contestant composition, and geography influence audience engagement.

Across three milestones, our work evolved from separate analyses of contestants, seasons, and engagement metrics into an integrated framework that connects:

* Casting decisions
* Realized survival intensity
* Audience size (viewership)
* Audience appreciation (IMDb ratings)

Milestone 3 focuses on combining these dimensions into one cohesive analytical structure.

## Data & Methods

We created two primary data aggregations:

* **Contestant-Level Table** (individual survivalists)
* **Season-Level Table** (aggregated season metrics)

Key methods used:

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* K-Means Clustering
* Log transformations for skewed engagement metrics
* Cluster validation (Elbow & Silhouette methods)

## Key Findings

* Difficulty is **multi-dimensional** (endurance, medical risk, geography).
* Geography alone does not determine difficulty.
* Demographics do not clearly define a “winner profile.”
* Harder seasons tend to receive **higher ratings but fewer viewers.**
* Season 1 is distinct due to unusually high popularity rather than unique survival structure.

Overall, we identify a **reach vs prestige tradeoff**:

* Endurance-heavy seasons build credibility.
* Moderated seasons attract broader audiences.

---

## Limitations

* Small number of seasons limits clustering stability.
* Mixed data types (boolean + continuous) complicate modeling.
* Demographic imbalance among contestants.
* Some missing viewership data.
